# BionoiNet
A deep learning-based framework for ligand-binding sites classification.

## Folders
* bionoi: a software that converts ligand-binding sites (.mol2 files) into Voronoi diagrams.
* bionoi_cnn: a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on the Voronoi representations of ligand-binding sites for classification.
* bionoi_ml: machine learning baselinies to classifiy binding sites.
* homology_reduced_folds: files containing folds such that the sequence identity between train and validation is less than 20%.
